"""What the frozen build must and must not contain.

These read video-factory.spec as text rather than building anything: a real
build is two and a half hours, so the mistakes worth catching here are the
ones that only surface in an installed copy, hours later, on someone else's
machine.

Both guards below come from bugs that shipped. A development machine has every
Python package lying around, so excluding one from the bundle changes nothing
locally and breaks the release.
