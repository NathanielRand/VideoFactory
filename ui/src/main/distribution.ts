// Which distribution this copy came from, and the two things that depend on it.
//
// Video Factory ships from two places out of one codebase: the NSIS installer
// on GitHub/Hugging Face, and an MSIX package in the Microsoft Store. The
// binaries are identical. Two behaviours are not, and both are rules rather
// than preferences:
//
//   * Updates. A Store copy is updated by the Store. Downloading and running
//     the NSIS installer over the top of a package Windows manages would at
//     best do nothing and at worst leave two installs fighting.
//   * Paying. Store policy 10.8.2 allows a third-party payment API but is
//     explicit that "users may be directed to a browser to complete
//     registration or transactions". Handing PayPal to the system browser is
//     the route the policy names, and it means a certification tester never
//     has to assess a payment page hosted inside the app.
//
// Detection is the runtime fact rather than a build flag. `process.windowsStore`
// is set by Electron itself when the app is running from an appx/MSIX package,
// so it cannot disagree with reality — a Store build mislabelled at build time
// would still behave correctly, and an NSIS build can never accidentally claim
// to be one.

/** True when this copy is running from an MSIX/appx package. */
export function isMicrosoftStore(): boolean {
  // Typed as optional: `windowsStore` exists only on Windows builds of
  // Electron, and is simply absent elsewhere.
  return (process as NodeJS.Process & { windowsStore?: boolean }).windowsStore === true
}

/** How this copy gets updated.
 *
 *   store   the Microsoft Store does it
 *   auto    electron-updater downloads and installs in place: the Windows
 *           installer, and a Linux AppImage (which can replace itself)
 *   manual  the user installs a newer build by hand: macOS, and a Linux .deb
 *
 *  macOS is manual because electron-updater installs through Squirrel.Mac,
 *  which refuses an app whose signature does not validate, and this build is
 *  ad-hoc signed (no Apple Developer ID; see electron-builder.yml). A .deb is
 *  owned by the system package manager, so replacing its files from inside the
 *  app would fight dpkg. Both would otherwise offer an update they cannot
 *  install.
 *
 *  Pure on purpose, taking its inputs, so it can be checked without Electron. */
